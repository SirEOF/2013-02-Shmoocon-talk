- The Mostly Real History of Crypto Attacks
  - Old ciphers that were broken by analysis
    - Caesar was easy
    - Enigma is a cool example
    - Cryptoquotes from the newspaper
  - Symmetric encryption
    - Had to share a unique key with everybody
  - Public key encryption was invented
    - Now Alice and Bob both send their key to Eve
  - CAs were invented
    - Some sort of tasteful goatse reference
  - Mention a couple other broken cryptosystems
    - While we're on the topic of goatse, WEP
  - Talk about stealing cryptokeys with git	
  - Usually implementations are broken, not the crypto itself
    - Not always true....
    - RC4
    - MD5
    - Etc.

- An introduction to some crypto concepts
  - Hashing
  - Encryption
    - Stream cipher
    - Block cipher
      - Modes of operation

- Look, in good detail, at some of the more interesting crypto attacks
  in good depth (how they work, how they're exploited, how they're
  fixed):
  - Bit-flipping attacks against RC4 and other stream ciphers
  - Key re-use in stream ciphers
  - Key re-use in block ciphers
	  - Compression attack
  - Padding oracle attacks
  - Hash length extension
  - Poorly generated random numbers (my favourite example is shuffling a deck of cards using a 32-bit seed)
    - Texas hold'em RNG fail

- Look at some of the solutions
  - Authenticated hashes - so important!
    - HMAC
    - EAX-mode for ciphers
    - Caesar challenge
  - When possible, encrypted data should not be put into the users' hands
  - Random numbers with real entropy
  - Eliminate passwords
    - Google's "war on passwords"

- How can we make this idiot proof?
  - Invent an easy way for developers to generate and manage keys,
    encrypt data, and sign the encrypted data, all in a safe way
